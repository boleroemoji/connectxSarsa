This is an example of 2 reinforcement learning agents training and performing against other predetermined RL agents. 
The agents are based on SARSA epsilon-soft policies and SARSA Lambda, with an epsilon greedy policy.
The agents are developed on a Connect 4 environment, in which they train and play against Kaggle's random agent and Negamax.
